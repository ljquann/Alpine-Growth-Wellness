            I was so impressed by these resilient succulent plants surviving at 14,000 ft despite the rough, rocky
            conditions. It inspired the name for my business – Alpine Growth."</em></p>

            <h3>Liz Downey, LCSW, MBA</h3>
            <h4><strong>Specialities: Trauma, Abuse, EMDR, Substance Use Disorders, Women's Issues, Anxiety, Depression</strong></h4>
                <p>Working with people has always been a passion for Liz. She received both her Bachelor's and
            Master's degree in Social Work from Saint Louis University in Saint Louis, Missouri. Liz began
            working with clients immediately upon graduating and has since worked in various social
            service settings in caseworker, therapist, and administrator roles. Liz's therapeutic experience
            includes working with those experiencing depression, anxiety, severe persistent mental illness,
            substance use disorders, relationship concerns, and survivors of violence. Liz has a deep passion for
            working with persons who have experienced trauma. </p>
            
           <p> Liz believes that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to healing and recovery and walks alongside
            her clients as they begin to make changes in their lives. She believes that the therapeutic relationship
            is hallmark to the process and incorporates trauma-focused modalities into all of her work. She uses
            Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) Therapy, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy,
            Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Solution Focused Brief Therapy, and Motivational
            Interviewing. She is currently working toward advanced certification in EMDR.</p>
            
            <p>When Liz isn't working, you can usually find her exploring the outdoors - from exploring the
            mountains, paddling in a lake, biking through the city, or tending to her garden.</p>
